            <h2>4.3 Username Enumeration</h2>
            <p>&emsp;Username enumeration is a security vulnerability where attackers identify valid usernames on a server or web application,
                 often facilitated by different server responses for existing and non-existing users.
                 Enabling attackers to use brute-force techniques to either guess or confirm valid users in a system.</p>

            <h2>7.2 SQL Injection</h2>
            <p>&emsp;SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that lets an attacker make queries with the database
                 by injecting an SQL command via the input from users to the application.
                 Which allows an attacker to extract sensitive information, modify database data,
                 execute administration operations on the database,
                 and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.</p>

            <h2>7.3 XSS and response injection</h2>
            <p>&emsp;Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject client-side scripts
                 into web pages viewed by other users. It allows attackers to bypass the same origin policy,
                 access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.
                 XSS can enable attackers to impersonate users, perform actions on their behalf, access their data,
                 and potentially gain full control over the applicationâ€™s functionality and data if those users have privileged access.</p>
